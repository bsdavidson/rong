        <p>This is a Pong game made in ReactJS. All the elements are simply
            DOM elements that are manipulated via event handlers and methods.
            Every moving element is handled through calling React setState at
            roughly 60 times per second and then simply allowing Reacts renderer
            to redraw. The collision detection code came from another project of
            mine <a href="https://github.com/bsdavidson/deathbot5000/">Deathbot</a>.

            This was done simply as an experiment to see if I could make a
            playable game using the DOM and React.
            Please don't make games this way.
          </p>
